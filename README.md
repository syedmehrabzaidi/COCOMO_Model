The COCOMO models are defined for three classes of software projects. Using Boehm's terminology these are: (1) organic modeâ€“relatively small, simple software projects in which small teams with good application experience work to a set of less than rigid requirements

-----------------------------------------------

The Basic COCOMO equations take the form:

E = a * pow(KLOC,b)

D = c * pow(E,d)

where E is the effort applied in person-months, D is the development time in chronological months and KLOC is the estimated number of delivered lines of code for the project (express in thousands).
